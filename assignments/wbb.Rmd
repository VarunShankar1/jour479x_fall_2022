## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
wbb <- read_csv("https://github.com/dwillis/wbb-rosters/raw/main/rosters_2022-23.csv")
```
```{r}
wbb %>% distinct(hometown)
```

```{r}
cleaned_wbb <- wbb %>%
  mutate(hometown_clean = str_to_upper(hometown))

cleaned_wbb <- cleaned_wbb %>%
  separate(col=hometown_clean, into=c("new_hometown", "state"), sep=",", extra="merge")

```

```{r}
cleaned_wbb %>% distinct(state)
```

```{r}
cleaned_wbb_rosters <- cleaned_wbb_rosters %>% 
  mutate(state = str_trim(state), state = str_replace(state, '\\.','')) %>% 
  mutate(state = case_when(
     is.na(abbr2state(state)) ~ state,
     TRUE ~ str_to_upper(abbr2state(state)))
  )
```
stuff above was done thursday, disregarding and starting over
```{r}
wbb <- read_csv("https://github.com/dwillis/wbb-rosters/raw/main/rosters_2022-23.csv")

years_cleaned <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2022/data/yearscleaned.csv")

wbb <- inner_join(wbb, years_cleaned) 

wbb <- wbb %>% 
  select(-count)
```
```{r}
hs_wbb <- wbb %>%
  filter(is.na(high_school))%>%
  filter(!is.na(previous_school))%>%
  filter(str_detect(previous_school, "HS"))%>%
  mutate(hs_clean = "")%>%
  mutate(hs_clean = previous_school)%>%
  mutate(type = "has hs")
extras_wbb <- wbb %>%
  filter(!is.na(high_school))%>%
  filter(is.na(previous_school))%>%
  #filter(!str_detect(previous_school, "HS"))%>%
  #filter(!str_detect(previous_school, "HS"))%>%
  mutate(hs_clean = "")%>%
  mutate(type = "no hs")
all_wbb <- bind_rows(hs_wbb, extras_wbb)
#we should be able to bind rows because these dfs should be at odds with each other, and we just want to stack them on top of each other
```
#A case when approach to high schools
```{r}
list=as.list(hs_wbb$previous_school)
wbb <- wbb %>%
  mutate(hs_clean = "")%>%
  case_when(
    is.na(high_school) && previous_school %in% list ~
    mutate(hs_clean = high_school))
```
if previous school is in the list and high school is NA
  put previous school in high school
