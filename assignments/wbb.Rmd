## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
wbb <- read.csv("https://github.com/dwillis/wbb-rosters/raw/main/rosters_2022-23.csv")

roster23clean <- wbb %>% mutate(hometown_clean = str_to_lower(hometown))

roster23clean <- roster23clean %>% separate(hometown_clean, c("new_hometown", "state"), sep=",", extra="merge")

rosters23clean <- rosters23clean %>% 
  mutate(state = str_trim(state), state = str_replace(state, "."",))
```
```{r}
  rosters23clean %>% distinct(state)
```
