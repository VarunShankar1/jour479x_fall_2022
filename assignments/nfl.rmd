## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Loading data
```{r}
pxp <- read_rds("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2022/data/play_by_play_2022.rds")
```
Filtering for McLaurin
```{r}
mclaurinplays <- pxp %>% 
  filter(game_half == "Half1", play_type == "pass", posteam == "WAS", !is.na(receiver), receiver == "T.McLaurin")
```

```{r}
comparison <- pxp %>% 
  filter(rusher == "Mi.Carter" | rusher == "Br.Hall" | receiver == "Mi.Carter" | receiver == "Br.Hall") %>% 
  group_by(rusher, receiver) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(yards_gained))
```

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
simulations <- rbinom(n=1000, size=210, prob=.372)
table(simulations)
hist(simulations)
```
