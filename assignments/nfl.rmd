## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Loading data
```{r}
pxp <- read_rds("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2022/data/play_by_play_2022.rds")
```
Filtering for McLaurin
```{r}
mclaurinplays <- pxp %>% 
  filter(game_half == "Half1", play_type == "pass", str_detect(desc, "McLaurin")
)
```
