## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(cfbfastR)
```
```{r}
install.packages("tictoc")
library(tictoc)
tictoc::tic()
pbp <- data.frame()
seasons <- 2014:cfbfastR:::most_recent_cfb_season()
progressr::with_progress({

  pbp <- cfbfastR::load_cfb_pbp(seasons)
})
tictoc::toc()
```

```{r}
glimpse(pbp)
```

```{r}
logs <- read.csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/footballlogs1121.csv")
```

Create a new column for point differential between the TeamScore and OpponentScore using mutate. You can use the same `logs` variable.

```{r}
logs <- logs %>% 
  mutate(differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore)

```

Create a regression (a linear model, like we did in this chapter (Links to an external site.)) investigating whether the number of penalties can predict the score differential. In a paragraph below this code block, describe the results: what is the p-value, and does it mean the results are random? Using the r-squared value, how much of the differential can be explained by penalty yards? How useful is this regression?

```{r}
fit <- lm(differential ~ Penalties, data = logs)
summary(fit)
```
The p-value for this regression is .01856, which shows that the results for this regression are not random using a significance level of .05. The R^2 value is .0002627, meaning that penalties have about a .02 percent chance of explaining the difference in score. This is a useless regression. 


```{r}
fit <- lm(differential ~ TotalTurnovers + DefYards + Penalties, data = logs)
summary(fit)
```
I used total turnovers, yards allowed and penalties as my columns that describe mistakes and bad outcomes. I don't think these overlap in any way, I took care to avoid multicollinearity. They are also all negative outcomes, committing penalties, allowing yards to the opposing offense and turning the ball over are all negative outcomes that have been theorized to impact games. The p value of 2.2e-16 is well below .05 and shows that this isn't a random regression. The R^2 value is .4534, meaning that these three variables can explain about 45 percent of the difference in score. 


```{r}
closelogs <- logs %>% 
  filter (differential <= 7 & differential >= -7)
fitsimple <- lm(differential ~ Penalties, data = closelogs)
summary(fitsimple)
```
When you define close games as ones where the margin was seven points or less, the simple regression between penalties and score differential turns entirely random as shown by the p-value of .1063, which is considerably higher than .05. 
```{r}
closelogs <- logs %>% 
  filter (differential <= 7 & differential >= -7)
fitmultiple <- lm(differential ~ TotalTurnovers + DefYards + Penalties, data = closelogs)
summary(fitmultiple)
```
When you define close games as ones where the margin was seven points or less, the multiple regression relatiKg turnovers, yards allowed and penalties is not random, with a p value less than 2.2e-16 and obviously less than .05, The R^2 is .05, which means that we can explain about 5 perccent of the difference in the score of close games by looking at these three variables. 

Penalties and point differential don't really have much of a relationship, it's not random but it's not meaningfully affecting games. I would not write this for a story other than to maybe note that we're overvaluing the impact penalties can have on games.  


```{r}
goaltogoplays <- pbp %>% 
  filter(year == 2022, pos_team == "Maryland", yards_to_goal < 5, down == (3 | 4))
```
