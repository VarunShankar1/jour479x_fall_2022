## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
logs <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2022/data/nbabubble.csv")

points <- logs %>% mutate(totalpoints = TeamScore + OpponentScore )
t.test(totalpoints ~ COVID, data=points)

```


```{r}
homecourt <- logs %>% filter(is.na(HomeAway) == TRUE) %>% mutate(differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore)
t.test(differential ~ COVID, data=homecourt)
```
