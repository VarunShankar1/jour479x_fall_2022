1. When we look at NFL quarterbacks, they are often very very bad as rookies. What are the things we can examine in the stats of those rookies that are good predictors for future success? Are there specific statistics that are good indicators for natural talent and good processing ability that are harbingers of future success? Limiting this to players on 

Does that data already exist? Can you get it?

Essentially, I'd like to find two things out: what are the pure statistical inputs for rookie quarterbacks that are indicative of future performance. For that I need play by play data, completions, yards, TDs, etc. This information would ideally be in a play by play format to break down by game situation as well (time left in game/score effects).
Do you need assistance in getting it?

We have one play by play dataframe we used from the 2022 season, it would be great if that data extended backward. 

What time frame do you want/need data from?

I'd do since 1999, that's all the data I have.  

Will you have to improve or augment the data in order to answer your question? If so, how?

Nothing in particular other than filtering for Rookies (doing so by just finding the names from the draft years).

Are there other examples of this kind of work (specific or general)? If so, provide them.
There's this article on what the effects are for quarterbacks depending on how much they were played as rookies.

This one did essentially what I'm doing but with draft prospects to model NFL success. https://www.the33rdteam.com/qb-hub/using-statistical-modeling-to-rank-quarterback-prospects/

```{r}
game_by_game_stats <- load_player_stats(
  seasons = TRUE,
  stat_type = c("offense"),
  file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")
)

draft_status <- load_players(file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")) %>% 
  select(display_name, gsis_id, position, draft_number, draft_round, rookie_year)
```
Alright so this is giving me all player game-level stats from 1999 onward for NFL players and their draft status in a separate dataframe. Let's see what I can do.
```{r}
total_stats <- game_by_game_stats %>% 
  filter(!is.na(passing_epa)) %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_epa = sum(passing_epa), career_games = n(), carr_pass_yards = sum(passing_yards), carr_pass_TD = sum(passing_tds))
```
First thing first, I excluded all players who had NA passing epa so I could then add it up for all players. I also summed up players' total games.
```{r}
game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats %>% inner_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 


game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% 
    filter(!is.na(rookie_year))

rookie_years_only <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% filter(season == rookie_year, draft_number < 100, position.x == "QB", season_type == "REG")
```
I join the game by game stats with the draft status and filter out players who don't have a rookie year listed.I then filter to get the regular season game logs for quarterbacks in their rookie years who were drafted in the top 100 picks. 
```{r}
rookie_years_only <- rookie_years_only %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id) %>% 
  summarize(rookie_games = n(), completion_perc = sum(completions)/sum(attempts), pass_yards = sum(passing_yards), pass_TD = sum(passing_tds), ints = sum(interceptions), sacks_taken = sum(sacks), pass_air_yards = sum(passing_air_yards), pass_first_downs = sum(passing_first_downs), rookie_epa = sum(passing_epa))

final_data_table <- rookie_years_only %>% left_join(total_stats, by=c("player_id", "player_display_name")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% left_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% 
  filter(rookie_games > 10) %>% 
  mutate(epapergame = total_epa/career_games)
```
I use that dataframe to make a dataframe that has the following statistics summarized for the rookie year top-100 pick quaterbacks.
- games played, completion percentage, pass yards, pass touchdowns, sacks taken, pass air yards, passing first downs, and rookie year epa. 
I then merged that dataframe with the statistics for the quarterbacks' careers and then that with the draft status again. Finally, I filtered out players who didn't play at least 10 games in their rookie season to eliminate small sample size issues and then divided the total epa by career games to make it a rate statistic.
```{r}
comp_perc_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ completion_perc, data = final_data_table)
summary(comp_perc_fit)

passyds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(passyds_fit)

passtds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_TD, data = final_data_table)
summary(passtds_fit)

int_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ ints, data = final_data_table)
summary(int_fit)


sacks_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ sacks_taken, data = final_data_table)
summary(sacks_fit)

air_yards_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_air_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(air_yards_fit)

first_downs_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_first_downs, data = final_data_table)
summary(first_downs_fit)

rookie_epa_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ rookie_epa, data = final_data_table)
summary(rookie_epa_fit)
```
Okay so, lot of stuff happened here. I ran regressions for each of the rookie year stats I gathered and the career epa per game and looked at the r^2 values. Let's review what we saw
Completion percentage
- p-value is less than .05 so this is a statistically significant relationship, but R^2 is just .15, meaning that rookie year completion percentage can only explain about 15 percent of career epa/game.
Pass Yards
- Again, p-value is less than .05, making this statistically signifcant. R^2 is .11, even worse than completion percentage. Yikes
Pass TDs
- P value is less than .05, makes this statistically significant. However, R^2 here is .1761, the highest so far but still pretty low.
Ints
- Not a statistically sig relationship. Doesn't seem to matter if qbs throw a bunch of picks as rookies (we call this the Peyton Manning theory)
Sacks
- p-value below .05, .17 R^2 value, around the same as passing touchdowns.
Air-yards
- Not a statistically sig relationship
Passing first downs
- Statistically signifcant relationship but only a R^2 value of .11
Rookie year EPA
- This is the best relationship you have, it's statistically signifcant and has an R^2 of .65. Now, it's slightly cheating because you're comparing the same stat, but it does have some value. What you see is that there's a relationship between rookie year success and the success for the rest of the career and that there is some extrapolation you can do from a players' rookie year EPA outward to see what to expect from them moving forward.
