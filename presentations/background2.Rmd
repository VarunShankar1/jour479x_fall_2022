outline for final notebook
- graphs showing
 pace difference for NBA and CBB
 efficiency difference (3pt shooting, assist rate, points per 60) for NBA and CBB
  broken down for p5 and non p5
- graph showing where shots come from (3pt rate and ft rate)
- analyze CBB data
  biggest differences across conferences/p5 v non p5 (if there are none that's interesting as well)
  highlight any wild outliers that are just fun to look at
- if wins

think that the established thought is that nba is more aesthetically pleasing (which I’m going to interpret as more offense, more threes, better shooting, better execution)
Think there’s a few stats I can look at, each to identify a different aspect
if there is a difference, think it’s worth examining why that could be, if there isn’t, i think that’s even more interesting
I’ll break it down further in the college ranks, how does it split for power 5 teams, for each conference, for the top 25 teams in wins over the timeframe im looking at
can make it further a breakdown about the gaps in play for teams within cbb as well, do big ten teams perform differently than sunbelt teams even tho they probs face similar rates of competition
will have a lot of interesting graphics and more segmented analysis to compensate for the somewhat simple question

```{r}
ByTeam <- CBBboxscores %>% 
  group_by(TeamFull) %>% 
  summarize(games = n(), wins = sum(wins), points_per_60min = sum(TeamScore)/games *(60/40), total_shot_attempts_per_60 = sum(TeamFGA)/games *(60/40), shooting_perc = sum(TeamFG)/sum(TeamFGA), three_rate = sum(Team3PA)/sum(TeamFGA), free_throw_rate = sum(TeamFTA)/sum(TeamFGA), three_point_perc = sum(Team3P)/sum(Team3PA), assist_perc = sum(TeamAssists)/sum(TeamFG)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(wins))
```
