## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
CBBboxscores <- read.csv("https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/cbblogs1522.csv")
NBAboxscores <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2022/data/2012-18_officialBoxScore.csv") 
```
Let's get a statistical profile for these games that inclues the following: total points scored, total shot attempts, shooting percentage, three-point rate, free throw rate, three-point shooting percentage, assists per made shot, assists to TO ratio, steals, blocks and fouls
```{r}

nba_stat_profile <- NBAboxscores %>% 
  summarize(games = n(), points_per_60min = sum(teamPTS)/games *(60/48), total_shot_attempts_per_60 = sum(teamFGA)/games *(60/48), shooting_perc = sum(teamFG)/sum(teamFGA), three_rate = sum(team3PA)/sum(teamFGA), free_throw_rate = sum(teamFTA)/sum(teamFGA), three_point_perc = sum(team3P)/sum(team3PA), assist_perc = sum(teamASST)/sum(teamFG))

cbb_stat_profile <- CBBboxscores %>% 
  summarize(games = n(), points_per_60min = sum(teamScore)/games *(60/40), total_shot_attempts_per_60 = sum(TeamFGA)/games *(60/40), shooting_perc = sum(TeamFG)/sum(TeamFGA), three_rate = sum(Team3PA)/sum(TeamFGA), free_throw_rate = sum(TeamFTA)/sum(TeamFGA), three_point_perc = sum(Team3P)/sum(Team3PA), assist_perc = sum(TeamAssists)/sum(TeamFG))
```
Having some tech difficulties with this next step, not sure what's wrong but this is the crux of my research. I'll compare the results of these profiles and see where the numbers differ, and visualize accordingly. This does feel a bit bare, I'm not sure if this question is too simple for this project and wanted to get your opinion. I feel like with the right visualizations it'll be good and answer the question I posed but I wanted to check with you just so it doesn't deal with regressions/predictive measures.
