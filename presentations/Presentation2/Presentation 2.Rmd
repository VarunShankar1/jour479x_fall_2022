The internet loves to debate about men's college basketball vs the NBA, specifically about the following question: Which sport is better to watch? I sought out to answer that question, focusing on three main areas:
- How fast do teams play, how well do they score and where do the shots come from?
To answer these, I identified various statistical areas I wanted to look at. For pace, I looked at total shot attempts per 60 minutes, for scoring I looked at shooting percentages, assist percentages and total points per 60 minutes and for where the shots came from I looked at three-point rate and free-throw rate. 
Let's look at what I found. 

NBA teams like to play faster, which makes sense since there's a smaller shot clock. This can often lead to more fast-paced games that also lead to more comebacks (you can't hold the ball and play 4-corners).
```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("nbacbbpacegraphs.png")
```
When you look at assist percentage, it's clear that NBA teams pass the ball around much better than men's college teams. This probably comes because NBA teams feature better players across the board who can break down defenses. It also could be because on men's college teams, you're still close to a level of competition where if you have one good player, he can entirely dominate. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("nbacbbassistpercgraph.png")
```
Men's college players make three-pointers a higher percentage of their total field goal attempts than NBA teams. This could be because you're often dealing with smaller players across the board and shooting is a "teachable" skill that coaches could emphasize. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("nbacbbthreerate.png")
```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("pacevpointscbb.png")
```
This graph shows a connection between playing fast and scoring a lot of points for individual men's college teams.

Let's get into the process. Got the data online, wanted to standardize over the same time period so only used box scores from 2014 to 2018.

```{r}
CBBboxscores <- read_csv("https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/cbblogs1522.csv")
CBBboxscores <- CBBboxscores %>% 
  mutate(year = year(Date)) %>% 
  filter(year >= 2014, year <= 2018) 

NBAboxscores <- read_csv("https://github.com/VarunShankar1/jour479x_fall_2022/blob/main/presentations/Presentation2/2012-18_officialBoxScore.csv") 

NBAboxscores <- NBAboxscores %>% mutate(year = year(gmDate)) %>% 
    filter(year >= 2014, year <= 2018)
```
```{r}
cols <- c("TeamFG", "TeamScore", "TeamFGA", "Team3P", "Team3PA")
CBBboxscores <- CBBboxscores %>% drop_na(any_of(cols))
  
nba_stat_profile <- NBAboxscores %>% 
  summarize(games = n(), points_per_60min = sum(teamPTS)/games *(60/48), total_shot_attempts_per_60 = sum(teamFGA)/games *(60/48), shooting_perc = sum(teamFGM)/sum(teamFGA), three_rate = sum(team3PA)/sum(teamFGA), free_throw_rate = sum(teamFTA)/sum(teamFGA), three_point_perc = sum(team3PM)/sum(team3PA), assist_perc = sum(teamAST)/sum(teamFGM))

cbb_stat_profile <- CBBboxscores %>% 
  summarize(games = n(), points_per_60min = sum(TeamScore)/games *(60/40), total_shot_attempts_per_60 = sum(TeamFGA)/games *(60/40), shooting_perc = sum(TeamFG)/sum(TeamFGA), three_rate = sum(Team3PA)/sum(TeamFGA), free_throw_rate = sum(TeamFTA)/sum(TeamFGA), three_point_perc = sum(Team3P)/sum(Team3PA), assist_perc = sum(TeamAssists)/sum(TeamFG))
```
Got rid of NAs and made statistical profiles for NBA and CBB that had
- points per 60, total shot attempts per 60, shooting percentage, three-point rate, free-throw rate, three-point percentage and assist percentage.


Making similar profiles for Power 5 v non-Power 5 schools and for individual conferences.

Finding out the statistical profiles for individual CBB teams.
