There is nothing more valuable in football than a good quarterback on a rookie deal. Because of the salary cap and the high salaries quarterbacks receive, quarterbacks who emerge as starters give their teams a signifcant advantage on the field because of their play and because of the additional player their teams can surround them with due to the financial flexibility. 

That makes quickly identifying whether a quarterback is worth building around paramount. However, because players generally tend to improve as they get further into their careers, teams need to be able to project their performance. What stats can they look at to estimate future passing performance? Let's take a look, comparing various statistical categories in players' rookie seasons to their career expected points added per game. 

I did not factor in rushing epa into this question, I wanted to limit the scope of the regression to pure passing performance to avoid any bias toward newer quarterbacks who have more robust rushing schemes designed for them.
 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(png)
knitr::include_graphics("rook_epa_reg.png")
```
When you run the regression between rookie year total expected points added and the quarterback's career passing epa/game, you get a pretty strong correlation, with an R^2 of .6605 and a p-value well below .05, showing statistical significance. Looking at the graph also shows that, good quarterbacks like Russell Wilson, Cam Newton and Justin Herbert all racked up solid expected points added as rookies and turned that success into good career numbers. 

Bad quarterbacks like Josh Rosen and Blain Gabbert stumbled in their first year and never found their footing. The major outliers are Josh Allen, who was not good as a rookie but is now is fantastic. However, this graph shows that few quarterbacks who are positive in passing epa as rookies end up as busts.

Now, this is a bit of cheating. You're comparing very similar stats here, total passing epa and passing epa per game. That probably factors into the strong correlation, but this does make sense. passing epa is a more advanced metric than anything else used here, it factors in a variety of factors including score, down, distance and time. 

It's a more situation-based metric than anything else being used and it makes sense that this would be the best way to measure quarterback passing success. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("pass_td_reg.png")
```
Rookie year passing touchdowns don't have the similar amount of success. Many good quarterbacks, including Matt Ryan, Lamar Jackson and Ben Roethlisberger did not throw for many touchdowns as rookies but still had great careers. 

There are multiple explanations for this, the main one being that touchdowns are just one play. If a quarterback leads his offense to the one-yard line and the running back leaps over the pile, he doesn't get that touchdown. That's shown in this regression's R^2, which is at .1761. That's higher than most of the other statistics we compared, but still not great. 

Let's look at how we got here, starting with loading player statistics and draft status.
```{r}
game_by_game_stats <- load_player_stats(
  seasons = TRUE,
  stat_type = c("offense"),
  file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")
)

draft_status <- load_players(file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")) %>% 
  select(display_name, gsis_id, position, draft_number, draft_round, rookie_year)
```
Now, let's group this by player names and id, and find out their total career passing epa, games played, passing yards and passing touchdowns. To add up passing epa, I excluded all players who had NA passing passing epa numbers. 
```{r}
total_stats <- game_by_game_stats %>% 
  filter(!is.na(passing_epa)) %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id, position) %>% 
  summarize(total_epa = sum(passing_epa), career_games = n(), carr_pass_yards = sum(passing_yards), carr_pass_TD = sum(passing_tds)) %>% 
  mutate(epapergame = total_epa/career_games)
```
Now, let's join the box score data with the draft statuses and filter out any player whose rookie year was not recorded.

Then, let's filter for quarterbacks drafted in the Top 100 picks and find out their total games played, completion percentage, passing yards, passing touchdowns, interceptions, sacks taken, passing air yards, passing first downs and passing epa during the regular season of their rookie year. 
```{r}
game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats %>% inner_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 


game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% 
    filter(!is.na(rookie_year))

rookie_years_only <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% filter(season == rookie_year, draft_number < 100, position.x == "QB", season_type == "REG")

rookie_years_only <- rookie_years_only %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id) %>% 
  summarize(rookie_games = n(), completion_perc = sum(completions)/sum(attempts), pass_yards = sum(passing_yards), pass_TD = sum(passing_tds), ints = sum(interceptions), sacks_taken = sum(sacks), pass_air_yards = sum(passing_air_yards), pass_first_downs = sum(passing_first_downs), rookie_epa = sum(passing_epa))
```
Now, let's merge the rookie stats table with total stats and draft status. Then, let's filter for players who played at least 10 games as rookies to exclude players who only got limited action in their first year.
```{r}
final_data_table <- rookie_years_only %>% left_join(total_stats, by=c("player_id", "player_display_name")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% left_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% 
  filter(rookie_games > 10)
```
Now, let's run a regression between the following stats as the independent variable:
completion percentage, passing yards, passing touchdowns, interceptions, sacks taken, passing air yards, passing first downs and rookie year passing epa
And career passing epa per game as the dependent variable. 
```{r}
comp_perc_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ completion_perc, data = final_data_table)
summary(comp_perc_fit)

passyds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(passyds_fit)

passtds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_TD, data = final_data_table)
summary(passtds_fit)

int_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ ints, data = final_data_table)
summary(int_fit)

sacks_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ sacks_taken, data = final_data_table)
summary(sacks_fit)

air_yards_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_air_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(air_yards_fit)

first_downs_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_first_downs, data = final_data_table)
summary(first_downs_fit)

rookie_epa_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ rookie_epa, data = final_data_table)
summary(rookie_epa_fit)
```

Okay so, lot of stuff happened here. I ran regressions for each of the rookie year stats I gathered and the career passing epa per game and looked at the r^2 values. Let's review what we saw
Completion Percentage
- p-value is less than .05 so this is a statistically significant relationship, but adjusted R^2 is just 0.1385, meaning that rookie year completion percentage can only explain about 14 percent of career passing epa/game.
Pass Yards
- Again, p-value is less than .05, making this statistically signifcant. Adjusted R^2 is 0.09509, even worse than completion percentage. Yikes
Pass TDs
- P value is less than .05, makes this statistically significant. However, R^2 here is 0.1615, the highest so far but still not ideal.
Ints
- Not a statistically sig relationship. Doesn't seem to matter if qbs throw a bunch of picks as rookies (we call this the Peyton Manning theory)
Sacks
- p-value below .05, 0.1793 R^2 value, the highest so far.
Air-yards
- Not a statistically sig relationship
Passing first downs
- Statistically signifcant relationship but only a R^2 value of 0.09374. 
Rookie year passing epa
- Best relationship at .6605

Let's go back to the top with rookie year passing epa. Let's be clear, quarterbacks are not usually good in their first seasons, only 13 quarterbacks drafted in the top 100 picks have finished with positive expected points added as rookies. The mean career passing epa for those players is 340.28 and the median is 166.27. Let's see where those numbers would rank among the data we have. 
```{r}
positive_rookies <- final_data_table %>% 
  filter(rookie_epa > 0)
positive_rookies

summary(positive_rookies$total_epa)
```
```{r}
qb_stats <- total_stats %>% 
  filter(position == "QB") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_epa))

qb_stats
```
340.28 puts us somewhere between 21 and 22nd on this list, between Eli Manning and Jimmy Garoppolo. 166.27 puts us just above Cam Newton. 

How does this change when you factor in rushing performance? A brief look, doing the same stuff as above but adding in rushing EPA. 

```{r}
game_by_game_stats <- load_player_stats(
  seasons = TRUE,
  stat_type = c("offense"),
  file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")
)

draft_status <- load_players(file_type = getOption("nflreadr.prefer", default = "rds")) %>% 
  select(display_name, gsis_id, position, draft_number, draft_round, rookie_year)

total_stats <- game_by_game_stats %>% 
  filter(!is.na(passing_epa), !is.na(rushing_epa)) %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_epa = sum(passing_epa)+sum(rushing_epa), career_games = n())

game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats %>% inner_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 


game_by_game_stats_with_draft <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% 
    filter(!is.na(rookie_year), !is.na(passing_epa), !is.na(rushing_epa))

rookie_years_only <- game_by_game_stats_with_draft %>% filter(season == rookie_year, draft_number < 100, position.x == "QB", season_type == "REG")

rookie_years_only <- rookie_years_only %>% 
  group_by(player_display_name, player_id) %>% 
  summarize(rookie_games = n(), completion_perc = sum(completions)/sum(attempts), pass_yards = sum(passing_yards), pass_TD = sum(passing_tds), ints = sum(interceptions), sacks_taken = sum(sacks), pass_air_yards = sum(passing_air_yards), pass_first_downs = sum(passing_first_downs), rookie_epa = sum(passing_epa)+sum(rushing_epa))

final_data_table <- rookie_years_only %>% left_join(total_stats, by=c("player_id", "player_display_name")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% left_join(draft_status, by=c("player_id"="gsis_id")) 

final_data_table <- final_data_table %>% 
  filter(rookie_games > 10) %>% 
  mutate(epapergame = total_epa/career_games)
```
```{r}
comp_perc_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ completion_perc, data = final_data_table)
summary(comp_perc_fit)

passyds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(passyds_fit)

passtds_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_TD, data = final_data_table)
summary(passtds_fit)

int_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ ints, data = final_data_table)
summary(int_fit)

sacks_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ sacks_taken, data = final_data_table)
summary(sacks_fit)

air_yards_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_air_yards, data = final_data_table)
summary(air_yards_fit)

first_downs_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ pass_first_downs, data = final_data_table)
summary(first_downs_fit)

rookie_epa_fit <- lm(epapergame ~ rookie_epa, data = final_data_table)
summary(rookie_epa_fit)
```

Lot of the R^2 values get even worse, which makes sense considering we're now considering passing statistics to a statistic that encapsulates rushing and passing success.

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=final_data_table, aes(x=rookie_epa, y=epapergame)) +

    )  +
